    "title": "First 24 Upgrades for my Ender 3 Pro - Part 1",
    "transcript": "hey my name is scott and i really enjoy upgrading and modding stuff just random stuff across my apartment and recently i just got the ender 3 pro and this is one of the cheapest high quality fully open source 3d printers on the market with a huge community of people just modifying and improving this thing and even third-party companies manufacturing parts and upgrades for it so naturally when i finished assembling it i got pretty carried away [Music] but before we start personalization step one the brand [Music] step 2 add something unique to your printer [Music] step three mark its birthday [Music] so i'll be starting with the simpler upgrades and then working my way to the more complex ones some of these you'll be able to print on your own and others you'll have to buy all right let's make this quick so if you have your 3d printer anywhere near your bed you probably find it hard to sleep with the lcd screen being so bright a lot of the solutions for this on thingiverse require some sort of swinging screen cover and that can actually hit into the x-axis if you're not careful so i went with this design it's a lot simpler and that's all you need [Music] whenever i print with petg i find a lot of plastic debris in the v-slots at the front of the printer so i found these simple v-slot strips they have these in different lengths for all the extrusions on the printer but i just decided to do the four at the front to avoid debris [Music] so i used this beautiful scraper way more than i thought i would so here's a minimal holder that keeps it right above the power supply unit so it's always there when you need it [Music] so a common problem with the ender theories is that the z-axis motor is actually a bit too close to the frame of the printer if you measure the distance between the threaded rod and the frame at the bottom and then the top you actually find that it's closer at the bottom which means it's slowly bending the threaded rod over time there's a few z-axis motor spacers on thingiverse that solves this problem and these basically just release the stress put on the threaded rod i also added this next piece which uses a ball bearing to provide further stability to the threaded rod from the top of the printer all right so quick disclaimer here i just found out if your threaded rod isn't going perfectly straight up and you add this top bearing you can potentially bend the threaded rod even more understandably so even though i'm not having any problems with it on my printer you might back to the video [Music] so i was initially not going to do anything about these droopy cables back here and then i saw this photo on reddit yeah this guy's cable got stuck in his print in his print that is so messed up so i had to do something about these cables so cable chains look like a lot of work but this was actually only three print batches only three of the pieces needed support material and they were pretty easy to remove installing the whole thing was also pretty easy [Music] and i didn't even end up needing all the pieces so yeah [Music] the first thing i did was preheat the bed to around 65 degrees this makes removing the magnetic surface a lot easier and once that's complete you got yourself a new fridge magnet yeah i cleaned the surface with some mineral spirits and now it's ready for the new glass bed [Music] i replaced the stock springs with some more rigid ones and then added on the 3d printed handle and added on these aluminum leveling knobs [Music] now it's just readjusting the z-stop for the thickness of the glass bed and that's it for all the bed stuff [Music] this adapter allows you to use an sd card instead of a micro sd card this is more convenient and it also prevents you from wearing out the card reader on the main board [Music] this is my fluffy microphone the original print for this enclosure had a wall on the side of it which meant that when you used the usb slots on the printer it left the cables running off the front of it and i didn't like that very much so i used fusion 360 to basically knock out those walls and that allowed me to use a 90 degree cable instead and that actually makes this my first thingiverse remix so now the cable runs off to the side neatly and brings the usb to the back of the printer for purposes i will get into later for shadowing so next up is the dual gear metal extruder the stock extruders on the ender 3 are mainly made out of plastic parts so that's not going to last you very long even if you don't get this extruder upgrade i highly recommend you properly calibrate your e-steps i'll link to a tutorial for this down below this guy goes through them in great detail but i still highly recommend this metal extruder upgrade because not only is it dual gear it's fully metal so it's going to last you a long time in fact this is actually one of the first upgrades i put on my ender 3 which is why i don't have any footage from it so all right bowden tubes these things can go up to a higher temperature than the stock ptfe tubing and i'm also using these with luke hatfield's extruder hack this guy is from vancouver that's where i'm from what's up dude now i'm not going to go into detail about his design and how it works but i'll link to those tutorials down below basically if you ever want your extruders to last longer and not get extruder clogs i highly recommend this hack here is another upgrade i wish i got right away a bl touch i wasted so much time leveling my bed and this thing just changed everything [Music] this thing was definitely a pain to set up and install but honestly super worth it having a leveled bed isn't even something i really need to think about anymore [Music] next up is the skr mini e3 by big tree tech this thing is probably the most bang for your buck upgrade you can possibly get it directly replaces the stock motherboard with all the connections going to the same places so it's very straightforward to install there are many benefits this board offers but the main reasons i got it is because it allows for easy firmware updates without a bootloader so i can basically get that thermal runaway protection to avoid fires and this thing also makes your printer motors pretty much silent so this thing replaces the need for any sort of tl smoother or motor dampeners so for only around 35 dollars i think this thing is a no-brainer [Music] here i'm using adjustable buck converters to step down the power supply's 24 volts to around 5 volts [Music] i'll be using two of these circuits one for powering the leds and the other for a raspberry pi [Music] so [Music] there's really a lot of room left in this enclosure design so i'll be hiding some extra snacks and chips in mine to save for later [Music] and then the usb cable from earlier can now be plugged into the raspberry pi [Music] the main reason for adding the raspberry pi is of course for octoprint octoprint allows you to control your printers remotely monitor your prints over a webcam record these sexy time lapses and with the bl touch installed you can even get detailed visualizations of your bed to make it even more leveled [Music] and that's it [Music] all right so those are all 24 upgrades i added to my ender 3 pro in the first two months of owning it the thing is this video took so long to edit i've already started thinking about more upgrades and stuff so i just got the laser engraver add-on i'm considering adding a better cooling duct i might add plotting capabilities to this thing and also contemplating getting an all metal hot end as well if you guys have suggestions please comment them below and if i get enough upgrades maybe i'll make a part two that's pretty much everything thanks for watching [Music] you"

    "title": "Making a Portable Mac Mini",
    "transcript": "so pewdiepie gave my last youtube video a shout \nout and now cool twitch streamers are watching   my videos on their stream i'm also about \nto hit a hundred thousand subscribers so   a lot of exciting stuff but anyways this is \na weird project there's not really a demand   for this one it's just something that's \nbeen bothering me for a long time so   yeah let me explain you see i hate laptops so much \nback in school i used to carry around a freaking   fan just to keep my laptop from overheating i \nhad to carry this phone with me everywhere and   it was awful and even now in 2022 i still need \nto keep a fan under my work laptop to keep it   cool when i'm running heavy things i feel like \nlaptops just aren't very reliable i've had to   replace so many batteries other components \nand eventually they always stopped working   and that's why i love my mac mini m1 this thing \nis very affordable crazy good performance i do   all my youtube video editing on these and it \nnever overheats but the problem is of course   i can't take it everywhere with me \nand i'm surprised by the fact that   nobody has really taken advantage of how \nsmall it is and made it more portable i mean   people have tried but their approach \njust didn't look very practical to me so so i like to start with what i call a \nvisual vomit so the goal is to get all   the ideas out of your head as quickly as \npossible without being too critical now i   know drawing on a blank piece of paper can \nbe really intimidating so i like to use a   whiteboard marker on my monitor with \nthe help of some pictures so what if what if it was like a macintosh and i just \nbuilt a display directly on the mac mini but   the mac mini would somehow need to be detachable \nso what if it was like a vhs player but instead of   inserting vhs tapes you insert the mac mini maybe \nit's like the game boy actually where you have a   keyboard and a screen and the mac mini plugs \nin the backside kind of like a game cartridge   a bit too bulky um maybe it works with a usb \nhub and the mac mini is actually sandwiched in   the middle with a screen and the screen's angle \ncan be adjusted or maybe to keep it simple it's   just like a laptop form if i don't like how \nan idea turns out i can quickly erase them   and if i like something i can easily alright \nnow we do some more detailed drawings now initially i was designing this thing to work \nwith one of those hdmi monitors that i've used   in the past but then when i was drawing on my \nipad mini i noticed the ipad mini is actually   the exact same width as the mac midi like \nthey were made for each other it's perfect so and that's pretty much it a usb to usbc \ncable can be held in place and protected   add some finishing touches and there's also a slot in the back to \nstore the power cable now i usually keep   this thing hanging under my desk and then \nwhen i need to leave to go work somewhere and when i get to where i need to \nwork it's pretty quick to set up using a cabled connection the duet app can \nsupport full retina resolution completely offline   it also supports touch screen capabilities \nso i don't need to carry a mouse with me and it's actually pretty intuitive to use i \ncan adjust the screen's angle to whatever is   comfortable and if it's ever loose i can grab \nthe allen key stored on the side and tighten   things up as needed so if you can't tell i really \nlike this thing i've been doing more traveling   recently and i bring this thing with me everywhere \nin fact i edited a portion of this video in canada   in a coffee shop with my family all using \nthis setup so that was pretty cool i know a   lot of people are gonna say like why not just \nbuy a laptop this is silly but like i said i   hate laptops and isn't this the point of being \na maker that we can make weird solutions to our   own very unique problems so yeah i know it's not \nfor everybody but i'm personally psyched to keep   using this thing anyways if you didn't notice \nfrom the very subtle product placement earlier   i have merch now if you want to support my channel \ncheck them out in the links below there's only a   few products right now but i got a lot more coming \nsoon i've been designing everything myself working   really hard with manufacturers making sure all \nthe stuff is high quality so please check it out   in this video i tried to show a little bit more of \nmy design process a lot of the behind the scenes   stuff usually that stuff i don't include because \ni find it personally kind of boring and too   educational but let me know in the comments below \nif you guys like that do you guys want to see more   design process stuff or less i personally think it \ncan get boring but that's just my opinion and uh   yeah it's been really busy i've also been trying \nto spend more time with my friends and family and   a lot of the freehand shots you saw in this video \nwere actually only possible because my dad was   able to film a bunch of them for me it was a lot \nof fun working with him and yeah huge thank you   to my family for helping me with this video also \nhuge thank you to the donators this time we got   viorell ianescu kian dowd thank you for the kind \nwords ian bullard terry shu and chun chen thank   you all so much for the support and uh that's \npretty much everything thanks for watching guys so you"

    "title": "Making an iPhone Standby Mode Dock ft. OVERWERK",
    "transcript": "this video is sponsored by bamboo lab and made in collaboration with overwork so one of my favorite iPhone features is standby mode basically when you charge your iPhone horizontally it goes into this full screen clock experience with widgets and apps all designed for easy glance ability for example if I set a timer right now and put the phone in standby mode the whole screen displays the remaining time on my timer anyway a couple of days ago this music producer and artist named overwork hit me up with this idea to design an iPhone doc specifically for standby mode and what caught my attention is that he wanted to create this design based on an old product one from one of my favorite designers and actually one of Apple's biggest Inspirations Theodor ROMs if you're an artist or a designer and you don't know who this is you got some homework to do he's a German industrial designer who started working at Brun in 1955 almost 70 years ago but his work there completely revolutionized the way we thought about consumer products his influence on design technology ology and Manufacturing can still be seen everywhere around us he created this and then Akia made this he designed this son he made this even the ex- head of design at Apple Johnny I aluminium designed some of Apple's most iconic products using a lot of the same design language that deodor ROMs defined now in 1976 he designed this alarm clock the dn40 and this is the product overwork was inspired by he thinks this is the perfect form for an iPhone standby mode dock and uh he just sent me his design for the first prototype uh for this project I'll be using the A1 Mini 3D printer that bamboo lab just sent me I've wanted to try one of these for a while now the A1 series has been my go-to recommendation for beginners because of their features reliability print quality and affordability so let's put it to the test [Music] okay so here's the design that overal work has put together so far it holds a MAG safe charger which perfectly holds the iPhone in place within the body and now it's in standby mode perfect but I want to add a bit more to this design for starters taking out the iPhone can be a bit awkward since it's fully sitting inside this body there's no Edge you can grab onto overwork designed it so you can push in on one side of the iPhone which would pop out the other end he did this with these tilted walls beside the mefe charger but I feel like this interaction can be improved upon and you guys know how much I love um a satisfying ejection button so I want to work that into the design and next I also want to add in the back here an additional wireless charger for my airpods this way the back won't all just be decorative even though it have some functionality and I think that's it but before I print this I think uh my A1 Mini needs some customizations [Music] [Music] I'll be using an Apple Watch charger in the back because they're a lot smaller then I added some nonslip so they con adhesive strips to the bottom to act as [Music] feet and now it's ready the iPhone's in standby mode and I can charge my airpods in the back and when I want to grab my iPhone so this is what we're calling the iPhone dm40 dock and I love that it feels like an object from an alternate universe like as if in another timeline in the Multiverse somehow Braun and apple came together and had the opportunity to collaborate and they gave birth to this object even working on it I was talking to overwork and he said that it felt like a spiritual collaboration between not just him and I but also between Johnny IV and deodor ROMs a weird collaboration between the four of us that could have never actually happened so this iPhone dm40 Doc is our homage to one of our favorite products by one of our favorite designers the dock works best on your nightstand or at the corner of your desk allowing you to get the most out of Iphone standby mode and it looks great in other colors just like the original dm40 did if you're interested in 3D printing one of these for yourself this design for the iPhone 15 Pro will be free for download in the link below if you have another iPhone model I will also be releasing the project files for those of you who are comfortable with editing 3D models and fusion I might also make a tutorial for my channel members if you guys are interested but if you guys just want to buy one overwork was telling me that he might produce a few of these to sell so let us know in the comments if that's something you're interested in as well he is such a talented artist and musician he made all the great songs that were used in this video check out his music on YouTube and Spotify also linked below now at one point in De rams's career he asked himself The crucial question is my design good design to answer this he uh he developed his famous 10 principles of good design I thought I would grade bamboo Labs A1 Mini 3D printer using some of these principles one good design is innovative the way this printer can print with four different filaments at once at this price point using its AMS system is unlike anything I've seen on the market making it definitely Innovative two good design makes a product useful this printer's Auto calibration and bed leveling made the printer so easy to use right out of the box I was so impressed so yes definitely useful three good design is aesthetic well just look at this thing four good design makes a product understandable the user interface mobile app and desktop slicer are all super intuitive so yes seven good design is long lasting aside from being very durable bambo laap also sells most of all the parts you will ever need for basic repairs on its website eight good design is thorough down to the Last Detail I used to hate replacing my 3D printers nozzle it's scary tedious and risks print failure if you do it wrong but on the A1 Mini that's it it's too easy the designers definitely cared about every Last Detail 10 good design is as little design as possible this definitely feels like the most minimal design possible not just aesthetically but also in terms of How It's engineered it's small it's light and at this price point it's all very impressive so those are a few of theod rams' design principles and in conclusion I definitely consider this 3D printer a good design if you want to grab your own A1 Mini or check out the other amazing 3D printers from bamboo lab check out the links below and huge thank you to Bamboo lab for sponsoring this video anyway this project was so much fun to work on with over work it's not every day I get to design and brainstorm with another artist and we're so happy with how it turned out and also very excited to be sharing this design with you all if you make one please send us photos of it tag us on Instagram or shoot us photos in the DMS we would love to see it so yeah thanks for watching [Music] he [Music] [Applause] [Music]"

    "title": "Making a Macintosh Studio",
    "transcript": "[Music] this is what I'm calling the Macintosh Studio it's an iPad Mini do on a Mac Studio with a few built-in features and uh here's why I made it one the Mac Studio takes up a lot of room on my desk it's really designed to sit under your monitor but I already have enough stuff under my monitor so this thing is just getting pretty annoying two completely unrelated but I've been wanting a dock for my iPad Mini currently I don't have it plugged in so whenever I need to use it its batteries are dead I also don't love the fact that since it's a portable device it's completely underutilized when I'm at my desk so ideally I can use it as a small external monitor instead of it just sitting there all the time and three weirdly enough the iPad Mini is the exact same width as the Mac studi so it's like they were destined to be brought together now what's hard about this project is really how bulky this thing is this thing is thick so I'm actually going to be taking inspiration from another very bulky design from Apple the first ever Mac they made one of my favorite classic designs the 1984 Macintosh hello I am Macintosh Macintosh the computer for the rest of us Macintosh the Apple Macintosh Mac step one brainstorm all right let's take a look so of course the iPad will be where this screen is and the Mac Studio will make up most of its base but then we have all this extra body and I don't want all that to to just be decorative so let's see what we can do with that space maybe the back opens and I can store pens in other stationary inside but then you'd have to open it just to grab a pen maybe there's slits down the body of this thing so it can hold paper and letters I don't really get letters what else could it hold what if there's cup holders big enough for Stanley tumblers even no I like the idea of it holding other things on my desk though timer charger what about my speakers or maybe it can help organize other Tech accessories like like maybe my headphones maybe it can hold my headphones or what are other things it can hold maybe external storage for my Mac Studio or maybe a whole raid system for all my hard drives and backup files probably won't fit what if the front had a removable magnetic plate that way I can have different plate designs that are interchangeable and they can work with different iPad models uh that's a bit much let's just start 3D modeling [Music] [Music] [Music] now my iPad can be used as an external monitor while staying fully charged and with this mini monitor in my peripherals it's great for putting on YouTube videos controlling Spotify when I'm working or for drawing up quick things with the apple pencil when I want to remove the iPad the bottom has an ejection button and it can also be used to lower the iPad in gently on the side there's a built-in holder for my headphones and the back drawer can be used for storing external ssds I also made another drawer design for holding my old hard drive so now I can keep all my old project backups easily accessible I couldn't help myself but also take a little bit of inspiration from the old color ful iMac g3s and print one of these in color too I still prefer the white for this but the color does contrast the cold aluminum pretty well and I can imagine this looking pretty good in other colors now because this stand design fits over the Mac Studio and the Mac Studio actually has the same top Dimensions as the Mac Mini it means this design can be easily tweaked to work with the Mac Mini I still need to figure out how the iPad ejection button and the other features will work with a smaller form factor but it should be pretty straightforward to to tweak the design so if you guys are interested in the version of this for the Mac Mini let me know in the comments but in the meantime if you want to 3D print your own Macintosh Studio or modify this design for your own needs check out my membership below to access all the project files I just launched this membership and I'll be sharing all my project files there from now on including the files for past projects like the 3D printed draw organizers that a lot of you guys have been asking for those will be up next month they're almost ready I just got to clean up the files a bit before they're ready to be shared but if you join today you'll also get access to exclusive design and 3D modeling tutorials let's design a customized drawer for the Macintosh Studio let's design some custom drawer organizers starting with this module for holding your SD cards at USB director's commentary for this video will also be up soon tap the join button below to learn more about my membership but uh yeah some of you guys might remember this but I've actually been sitting on this Macintosh Studio idea since the portable Mac Mini video and it's just one of those projects that I had to materialize in order to move on because it's been on my mind for way too long but how perfect is it that I would get this done finally this year because this year also happens to be the 40th anniversary of the original Macintosh sadly this isn't actually the original this is the um the classic 2 which was the only one I could get my hands on but fun fact about the original model Steve Jobs saw the original Macintosh like it was an art piece so if you P it open you can actually find the original team members names as well as his own embossed into the enclosure pretty cool right so I meant to put this video out sooner but I'm actually in the process of moving apartments right now so it's been pretty busy but uh you know this was a heavily requested project in the comments so I hope you guys enjoyed it because I really enjoyed designing this thing and putting the video together using the new 3D printer and everything my next video will probably be for my new apartment and so so I hope I'll see you guys there I already started working on the script for that video and I'm pretty excited it's it's actually been like 10 years in the making and it's this you know what actually no spoilers that's all I'll say for now I hope I'll see you guys there so yeah thanks for watching girl I [Music] but I can never [Music]"

    "title": "Making 20 Upgrades for my Desk Setup - Dream Setups #2",
    "transcript": "This video is sponsored by Bamboo Lab. So, my desk setup might not look like much. It's definitely more on the minimal side, but what you don't see are a bunch of carefully crafted features that are designed to basically be invisible to people visiting my apartment. There is hidden storage and functions everywhere. It almost feels like magic at this point. It all started a while ago when I spent a whole year designing the perfect drawer organizers. I created a whole system to make accessing the tools I use every single day as efficient as possible. This really inspired me to maximize not just the organization of my tools, but how I use my whole desk setup all together. This is part of my new dream setup series. So, if you have any ideas for what should be my next episode or what kind of upgrades I should do, drop them in the comments below. But for now, let's make this quick. Let's start with charging cables. I want them easily accessible but never in the way. The easiest way to accomplish this is to actually just buy one of these adhesive retractable charging cable thingies and use its adhesive back to just stick it under your desk. But I decided I wanted to use this other one instead. It's a wall plug, which is a bit annoying, but it's way cheaper and it also comes with a USB outlet. This will definitely be useful under my desk. A lot of these upgrades are going to require custom designs. So, for this video, I'll be trying out the new P2S 3D printer from Bamboo Lab. [Music] I then plugged in the short extension cable and now it's ready. This is especially handy here for tools that draw power over USBC, like my soldering iron. And when I'm done, I designed one for the back of my desk, too. That orients the plug so it's poking up instead to charge things on my desk like my keyboard. And when I'm done using it, that's it. But I don't want to charge my phone here. That would get in the way. So, I'm actually going to install this. It's actually designed for laptops initially, but still works. And the same is true for my AirPods. I don't want these just sitting around getting lost and not staying charged. Now, the new AirPods, they're actually MagSafe compatible. And what I learned is that the magnets are strong enough to charge these even upside down. So I think I know the perfect spot to hide these. [Music] With this gummy double-sided tape, I can mount this print on the back of my studio display without worrying about residue marks if I ever need to remove it. [Music] [Applause] [Music] The back of my monitor has this little crevice that perfectly fits my SD card and CFX Express Type A card reader. It's like it was made to be here. So, [Music] I love how subtle it looks, but now it just feels like I have this extra functionality built into my monitor stand. So, to show just how much I hate unnecessary things on my desk and how far I'm willing to go to maximize my usable space, I got this laptop stand a while back. I really like it, but instead of using it with the metal base plate it came with, I actually just ended up drilling into my desk. And even though this isn't a huge functional upgrade, I just love how clean it looks now. And I never have to worry about stuff getting in the way of my laptop stand. Ambient light is super important for any good desk setup to reduce eye strain, but to also make your space look cozy, which is exactly what I want my desk setup to be. So, I wanted to design my own lamp. With designing any kind of light, it's all about controlling where the light goes and does not go and using that path of light to showcase form. This can be kind of tricky with 3D printing because unless you're using very thick walls, in most cases, the light's just going to shine through all of the plastic. That's kind of why most 3D printed lamps end up having this similar look. The light is just kind of shining through all of it. I got nothing against that, but I realized with Bamboo Lab's AMS system, I can 3D print with multiple colors at the same time. The AMS2 Pro also has active heating and venting, making it a perfect system for keeping all my filament in the best condition possible. I can use this bone white filament for parts of the print I want less light to shine through, paired with black filament to fully block light from passing through those areas. [Music] [Music] I think this design may have been loosely inspired by a certain building I walk by every day. I left the top open in case the light bulb gets warm, but with LEDs, heat isn't really a problem. So, instead, I'll be diusing the light up here with a lid, which makes it the perfect spot for this little dude. [Music] So, when I catch myself working too hard, this little guy reminds me to slow down a bit. >> I don't want to reach back here to turn the lamp on and off all the time from the switch. So, I'll be using a huge smart bulb, making this a smart lamp, so I can control this lamp along with all the other lights in my apartment from a single switch. This switch is actually very important. You see the lights in my background. I have multiple colors and brightness presets set for these guys and along with all the lights in my apartment for different tasks that I'm doing. If I'm filming, they're at a pretty low brightness preset so it doesn't overexpose the camera. If I'm just hanging out or I have guests over, they're in this slightly brighter and warmer mode. If I'm trying to be hyperfocused on my desk, I use this super bright configuration. And there's this one, too. H that's not the point is I use this controller a lot. But my problem is not only does it go missing very often. It's once again another item that's occupying space on my desk. So while I was trying to figure out where to hide this button, I noticed the ambient light of my desk is now uneven. I wanted another lamp on this side of my monitor. And I realized what if that lamp could also be the controller for all my lights. [Music] The Hue smart switch can slide right into this track. So now when I click down on the lamp shade, not only does it turn on the lamp, but it also controls all the lights in my living room. I can tap on it multiple times to toggle between different presets and even use gestures to adjust the specific brightness. [Music] Okay, I don't know if anyone can relate to this next one, but I have a really weird need when it comes to using my iPad. I always need to have two cases handy for it. When I need to use it for writing scripts, I use the Magic Keyboard case. When I'm watching content, drawing on my iPad, or doom scrolling, I need the flexibility of this origami stand case. So, I made this. These shelves can now hold both of my iPad cases along with the iPad in either one of them. With the charging cable close by, it can also ensure my iPad stays charged. Okay, let's talk about cable management. Some people like to go full out with modular boards and fancy systems, and I totally get that. But for me, my needs are simple. I just want something that looks clean and makes it easy to route and hide all my cables quickly. And I've tried a track systems and shelves, but this is definitely the best solution I've tried so far. It can fit my entire power strip inside and it's super easy to install and it's basically shaped like a taco. I can unhook the front to open it up and I can route all the cables inside. What I love about is that it's got these Velcro straps for me to hold everything neatly, but it also gives me the flexibility to basically just shove everything inside very quickly and easily if I'm in a rush. And either way, once I close up the taco, it always looks tidy from the outside. And that's good enough for me. This next design starts with me pausing the print right at the start. I can embed some magnets into it. And then I let the rest of the print finish. Next is this bracket. And same thing, I need to embed some magnets here and then here as well. These ones can fall out easily though since it's not stuck to the print bed. So I'm using some more magnets to clamp them in place. The bracket mounts under my desk with this guide and the bin attaches magnetically underneath. The way this works is that there is now a red line indicator on my desk for where the garbage can is. And so I can just push trash off this part of my desk. If I have smaller debris or dust on my desk, this red part of the indicator actually snaps off, revealing a brush that I can then use to sweep things up. So this brush is actually fully 3D printed. I got inspired by one of those hairy lion thingies that people love 3D printing and realized that with a bit of bridging, I can use that same technique to make a perfectly functional brush. So, when I have a bunch of eraser bits, I can also take off the bin and use it like a dust pan. And when I'm done, they can both return to the bracket magnetically. So, most of the projects for my YouTube channel are made on my old 3D printer, Bamboo Labs X1C. It's just super reliable despite its crazy print speeds. I love its AI powered camera monitoring system, multiaterial printing. It's always been my favorite 3D printer to use. But now that there's the new P2S, what's wild is that even though it's a cheaper 3D printer than the X1C, it somehow comes with all of those features I just talked about and even more. Yeah, it has a new quick swap nozzle design and brighter dual lights inside the enclosure. So, before on the X1C, this is all you can see from the outside. But now with the P2S, visibility has been drastically improved. Look at that comparison. With the better lighting, recording time-lapses, and videos just look so much better now. Tons of amazing new features, but my favorite are these little handles on the sides. Revolutionary stuff. My most recommended budget beginner 3D printer is still the A1 Mini. But if you're looking for something that can get you larger prints and has an enclosed system, is quieter, faster, and can just take your projects even further, the P2S is all that. This machine is a beast, and at this price point, it's a no-brainer. So, check out the links below for more information about it. And thank you to Bamboo Lab for sponsoring this video. Now, let's move on to my Alex drawers. This is a classic piece of furniture from IKEA that's part of so many desk setups. My desk's main drawer is very efficiently organized, but these, not so much. I've always felt like I can get more out of the Alex drawers, but the annoying thing is the drawers don't even fully extend. It's hard to use it maximum potential when I can't even reach the things in the back of it. So, let's change that. [Music] feel. [Music] Hey [Music] Okay, so this is Scott from the future. And this is the thing. The design heavily relies on the metal track behind it to reinforce these walls and keep everything straight. I know this because there's a scene later on where I pulled out the drawers very carelessly while there's a lot of weight inside the drawer. So, of course, without the metal track supporting these walls, all the dovetails snapped. Now, the funny thing is, I didn't even notice this at first. I reinstalled everything and everything still worked fine. So, although I think PLA definitely works for this project, I decided to reprint everything anyway with some carbon fiber reinforced PET plastic just to be safe for long-term use. The P2S's enclosed design makes it way easier to print material like this, which require more stable temperature and better fume control. And now, this just feels so much more rigid compared to the original PLA prints. Anyway, this is definitely a more technical upgrade. So, if you want detailed video tutorials on this and how to assemble the lamps from earlier, download all the 3D printable files from this video, consider joining my YouTube channel membership to access those and even access some behind-the-scenes content. I'll leave some more details about this in the description below, but yeah, all this work just for three more inches. 3 in might not sound like much, but now I can reach places I couldn't before. So, did you know the Alex drawers were the exact width of six Goodfinity boxes? Yeah, it's perfect. Lengthwise, not so much, but it's good enough. So, I'll be using that to organize a few of my less frequently used tools. This one's for my camera lenses. Extra Mag Safe batteries, other equipment batteries, my camera monitor, and some lens adapters. For the rest of the space, I'll be using it to finally address a problem that's been bugging me for such a long time. These annoying containers come with any hardware you buy, and they're never the same size. They're just awful to use. Gridfinity bins are perfect for this. I can use the different color filament to label each bin with their hardware size. These bins are designed with a small ramp inside them, which makes taking things out very easy. [Music] Now that all the bolts are sorted, I wanted to take advantage of the extra height in the drawer. So, I made this. [Music] And I'll be using this for different type of nuts, washers, everything that goes on bolts basically with an extra bin for miscellaneous stuff. [Music] Okay, another popular IKEA piece that everyone loves using for organization is the Scatteris pegboard. I'm so jealous of all the cool DIY projects and organization setups people have used this for. But my problem is my office is in my living room and a pegboard, no offense, but no matter how you dress it, it's always going to look like a workshop organizer. And I really don't want that look in my living room. Now, there's a corner of my room I always end up hiding my messes. It's this area just behind my Alex drawers. I always pile my film equipment there because it's just kind of a blind spot. So, what if I was able to hide the pegboard right there? [Music] Now my Alex doors has the scatteris pegboard functions. I can use IKEA's metal pegboard hooks for carrying heavy film equipment or design my own accessories. [Music] So, since my cameras are very expensive, I need these holders to never unhook by accident. So, I'll be locking them in with this additional print. Now, they're not going anywhere. This next unique holder is for holding my camera battery chargers. [Music] And this other one is for holding my sliders battery charger. I needed to make the hole slightly larger to route these cables through, but now I can easily charge my batteries right by my desk whenever they die. After the batteries are charged, I need a way to keep them somewhere where they're easily accessible. Initially, I wanted to make something like this. Two long springs run through this. It's basically an auto expensing magazine. Once batteries are loaded in, it's ready to dispense. As satisfying and fun as this is, there are three gliding problems. One, because the spring needs a lot of room to compress, only half of this whole vertical height can be used to store the batteries. That's a lot of wasted space. And because the batteries are loaded in from the top, where it's also where they're dispensed, it means that over time the batteries at the very bottom will never get used. That's not good. And three, because the pegboard on the drawer faces away from my desk, grabbing them from the front actually doesn't make a lot of sense. They should ideally dispense from the side where I can then easily reach them from here. So, I rotated the dispenser and took out the springs. And now this is a much better solution. Batteries are loaded in from the very top and dispense out the bottom. [Music] The extra space underneath lets me add a second dispenser for my larger slider batteries. Now I can grab these batteries right from the front. All right. I've been living with these upgrades for a few months now and I got to say I love them all so much and I have so many more ideas now on how I want to continue evolving not just my desk setup but my other drawers and furniture and really my whole apartment. So, I really hope you follow along with this new series. It's wild how much a few thoughtful improvements can completely change the way your space feels. The changes might look small, but when little tedious tasks like grabbing my camera, getting a new battery, and cleaning up a mess, when these tasks go from being annoying to something that's actually fun and satisfying to do, something changes. The barriers between thinking and doing, they start to fade and you just start wanting to create. And when this place is where I sit down to work every single day, that makes all the difference. A well-designed setup doesn't just make work easier, it makes it feel better. And when work feels good, you show up more, you finish more, and you try more. That's why this matters. Thanks for watching. [Music]"

    "title": "Organizing my Drawer with 3D Printing - Dream Setups #1",
    "transcript": "Hey, guys. So it's always been very important to me\nthat when I need to get to work, I can get to work as quickly as possible. But the problem is,\neven when I know exactly which SD card it is that I'm looking for\nand exactly where it is, I still have to... [digging through drawer sounds] With everything properly arranged. The USBs are even accessible now\nwithout the need to fully open the drawer. So this\nthis is actual organization, right? Because existing organizers\ndon't organize your stuff. They just kind of divide up your stuff\ninto smaller units of mess. So... After roughly laying out the main objects in their placements, \nI took a photo of it for reference. I also took reference photos\nof some of the objects individually with rulers when I needed their detailed\ndimensions for tracing. This one's for my sticky notes. and remember those hotel cards\nthat I like using as small whiteboards? Those go in here. Pens I don't use often will go\nin this bottom section, and for the pens I use often... it holds my main sharpie,\nballpoint pen,  and dry erase marker My nail clippers and lip balm with some storage below for refills. Of course, I can't have a perfect holder\nfor everything. There will always be\nmiscellaneous stuff, so... This grid holds my dry erase marker refills and other miscellaneous knives. My favorite Magsafe Chargers. I want easily accessible,\nbut yeah, they don't quite fit. If they're slightly slanted\nthough they fit so So, everything so far has been pretty \nfocused on organization, right? But I wanted a few modules\nto have some extra functionality. So this next one... Not only is this a lid that holds\nmy screwdriver but it can also double as a project tray on my desk for loose screws and parts\nwhen I'm disassembling stuff For this next print, there's a hole in the back for magnet\nwhich can be sealed with some hot glue. This helps the scissors lock into place. Right. Shoutout to the sponsor today, Ugreen. They just sent me their line of Nexode chargers\nand I am in love with these things. First up,\nwe have the Nexode Mini 45W charger. The charger that came with my iPad\nis about the same size, but it's only 20W. Ugreen’s is more than double\nthat at 45W and it has two USB-Cs so you can fast\ncharge two devices at the same time and then one size up, we have the Ugreen Nexode 65W charger. Apple's equivalent of this is once again\nway bigger and it only has one port Ugreen’s has a nice compact design\nwith three ports, two USB-Cs and an USB-A. And lastly, we got the big one. The Ugreen Nexode 100W charger. This is the full powerhouse. It can charge my iPhone three times\nfaster than the original iPhone charger. It adjusts power output\nto safeguard your devices and it's also got a super durable shell\nthat's designed for heat dissipation. My favorite feature on all of these however, is the fact that the prongs all\nfold in for easy packing and storing. So there you have it, three super functional\nand just beautiful looking chargers. Whatever devices you have, these\nhave you covered. So check out Ugreen’s\nnexode chargers in the links below and huge thank you to Ugreen\nfor sponsoring this portion of the video. Let's get back to the drawers. So in case you haven't noticed, most\nof the prints done so far has no bottoms. It's a bit more obvious on black. They also start with very sparse infill and only gets denser the higher it goes up where more supports and needed. These all contribute to reducing the amount of plastic used and of course\nthe printing time for each of these parts. So this is for a batteries, point-and-shoot, and microphone cable. For my electric screwdriver, precision screwdriver, deburring tool, and caliper. The last two modules\nwork together to hold a few things. First, the long ruler,\nmore Sony batteries Sony microphone, and my\nfavorite tape measure. Vinyl weeding tool and these tiny scissors. A hardware bin for miscellaneous hardware. And last but definitely not least,\nI wanted to include some of these holders\nfor organizing screwdriver bits. But I realized,\nI kind of hate these things. The bits are always hard to remove\nand put back in. They're actually pretty annoying to use. So here's what I came up with instead. So now I can grab the bits\nI need very easily. I can grab them on their own\nor take the whole row to use on my desk. To avoid clutter, I can also stick them to the front of\nmy drawers since of course, they're magnetic. So, if you're interested in\ndoing a project like this here are a few things to keep in mind. For starters,\nyou don't have to start from scratch. There are a lot of really cool\norganization systems online like Gridfinity which are open source\nand have a lot of different modules already designed, openly available,\nand completely free. Secondly, consider how you\nmight maximize vertical space. My organizer designs here\nallow the drawers to hold significantly more items than what it used to with all the items just laying flat. And lastly,\narrange the items in a hierarchy. I have the stuff that I use the most accessible at the very front,\nfollowed by the less important stuff and the longer items\nthat can reach all the way to the back. This ensures that the back of the drawer\nis being fully utilized as well. So I worked on this project\nalmost throughout all of 2022. It's the kind of project that you just\nknow would take way too much of your time. In fact, I actually put it off for a long time\nuntil I started to treat it as productive. productive procrastination. Basically, every time I would get bored\nwith another project or when something is taking way too long, I would open this project\nand just kind of slowly chip away at it. It was a lot easier to work on\nwith no deadlines and no stress, so it was nice to consistently feel a sense of accomplishment\nevery time I finished another module. So even though I was procrastinating\nfrom my other projects, I was also being productive\nin a way. it was so worth it too, because this is definitely\none of my favorite projects in a while. This has changed\nso much about how I use my drawer when I need to grab something\nI don't even really need to look anymore. Like, here's my point-of-shoot, here's my phone battery,\nhere's my dry erase marker. Isn't that awesome? I even started thinking about\nmaybe doing this for other disorganized stores in my life,\nlike maybe my kitchen utensil drawer? Sometimes I do wonder\nif maybe this is a bit too much, though. But then I look at it and it's just so beautiful. So yeah, I guess since I like it a lot\nand I made it for myself, I guess that's enough, right? Thanks for watching, everyone."

    "title": "15 More Upgrades for my Ender 3 Pro - Part 3",
    "transcript": "[Music] hey guys so after the part one video i got hundreds of suggestions and ideas for more fun upgrades i can add to my ender three thank you all so much for those comments and even though i can't get to all of them i decided to choose the ones that were most commonly suggested some improved the printer's ease of use and some actually improved the performance and even capabilities of this printer so some of these you can print yourself but most of them this time you'll have to buy and this time i'm actually going to start from the stuff i like the most and work my way to the stuff i like the least alright let's make this quick a lot of you guys got pretty nervous about this power supply unit muffler i don't think there's anything to worry about but you know what this didn't really make things that much quieter anyway so let's just try something else with the machine turned off and unplugged you can open up the power supply unit but i wouldn't touch anything on the inside double check the voltage on these fans if they're 12 volts you can basically replace them with any noctufan these are just way quieter compared to the stock ones [Music] next is the micro swiss all metal hot end these are a little pricey but they prevent you from ever needing to replace your ptfe tube and they can also handle higher temperatures allowing you to print with nylon and even polycarbonate it's also super easy to replace the stock hot end with these so i highly recommend it [Music] the one upgrade that so many of you guys suggested was of course direct drive and since i liked the all metal hot end from micro swiss so much i decided to try their direct drive conversion kit [Music] it comes with this gorgeous aluminum cartridge plate that replaces the stock units plate basically one to one wait let me explain the concept of direct drive is basically instead of pushing the plastic from the extruder all the way back here through this long tube to the hot end where it then gets melted direct drive takes all this stuff and puts it right on the tool head so the extruder and the tool head moves together as one unit now another thing a lot of you guys suggested was of course improving the cooling duct the stock unit just cools your prints from only one side and it's also very loud and the fans aren't very strong so i basically just took this whole thing off then i decided to use the set santa ducts it's got a very minimal design that makes it easy to remix and it also prints very easily in one piece i printed mine in petg so that it's a bit more heat resistant but that meant there was a lot of stringing because my pg settings suck my design was a remix of a remix it's a lot more compact and it works with this bl touch holder i designed that keeps it at the same height it used to be while the slots on the fan duct allow it to be height adjustable so what you just saw and the trick i showed you guys in the last video with the air duster so i thought these things are fine now since they no longer include any cfcs which is really bad for the ozone layer but it turns out there's still a lot of gases in these things that are bad for the environment so john johnson suggested a better way while your glass bed is still warm you can actually put a couple drops of water along the edges of your print and then capillary forces will actually slowly lifted up i've tried this before actually and it's pretty effective it's not as fast and it doesn't look as cool but it's probably better for the longevity of your glass bed and it's definitely better for earth so let's do that okay back to the cooling ducts next i replaced the hot end cooling fan with another nocto fan unfortunately these hot end fans run on 24 volts and noctua fans only come in 12 volts now the printer's main board actually has a lot of room inside the enclosure so i just added a buck converter in there in line of the fan's wires and then using that i converted the printers 24 volts down to 12. [Music] now for the part cooling fan i'm just using 24 volt blower fans i'm attaching these to the original wires with a housing and crimping set these would make replacing these fans in the future a lot easier or if i ever want to i don't know connect a laser engraver or something but that's for another video now with the blower fans installed there is now strong cooling for my prints from both sides okay so the direct drive kit comes with this piece at the back that still guides your filament from the side into the direct drive this actually means you're losing quite a lot of z-axis height for printing so i decided to turn my filament spool around and run the filament directly into the direct drive so i no longer need the bowden tube or the old filament guide and then i designed this small piece to help with the cable management i did michael from teaching tech's torture tests for cooling and overhangs and the results are quite impressive now there are both pros and cons to a direct drive setup like this for me the main reasons i'm using this is to improve my retraction settings and print with flexible filaments and i'm not just talking about flexible tpus i'm talking about the super flexible tpus like ninjaflex look at this stuff that's crazy this is definitely one of the more challenging filaments to print with but i was able to do it almost flawlessly with this [Music] setup so even without the bowden tube i'm technically still losing around five centimeters of printing height just due to the direct drive motor so i decided to try this thing [Music] these come with all the needed holes pre-drilled and they extend the frame z-axis by 10 [Music] centimeters [Music] so after adding in a few more cable chains this thing was done sadly with my setup i wasn't able to get all the way to the top i was about two centimeters short but i was able to reclaim the five centimeters taken up by the direct drive and a tiny bit more was this worth 40 dollars though i'll let you decide so i discovered these things called endoscopes when i was watching tested the other day and they're basically these cameras that people shove into their walls to check for leaks or mold or whatever they're very cheap 20 usb ones you can plug to your computer or octopi but for me i actually ended up using a much more expensive 80 one for its 12 megapixel camera this one works with a wi-fi transmitter so you can control it from a phone app [Music] [Music] [Music] now huge disclaimer with this one because it's definitely still a work in progress after using this endoscope for a while i found that this model actually heats up a lot being so close to the heated bed it got even hotter and then the air from the part cooling fan got on it which makes it fog up so sadly i wasn't able to get any recordings out of this thing longer than three to five minutes which really sucks i recently found this tutorial video from chili coke though who actually took a part an endoscope and permanently mounted it to their tool head which had way better results so i might try something like that in the future but for now this kind of works not only is this a great upgrade to monitor your prints or get cool footage but up close like this you can actually troubleshoot your print settings like retractions layer heights and all that you can easily see where blobs or other print issues might be coming from [Music] the stiffer yellow springs from the first video was a nice improvement but a lot of you guys said the silicone spacers are even better so i decided to try those there's no huge difference but the bed is definitely even more rigid now i learned the hard way that these clips can actually lose their flexibility over time this resulted in major layer shifts on this very important print i was making so i switched to proper bed clips that you guys suggested they're easy to remove and put on and i realized later on that you really only need two since they're super strong so just as how your hot ends heater block needs a silicone sock the heated bed can actually use a similar thing these are installation pads they come with an adhesive side for easy [Music] installation [Music] these warm up the bed faster and they also trap the heat inside like a blanket helping you save money on your electric bills i highly recommend this one for people who print often or use a high bed temperature as your printer ages it's important to make sure that the belts are kept fairly tight these add-ons make it a lot easier to adjust the belt tensions when you need [Music] to [Music] one sound i really can't stand is the sound of filament running low [Music] so the reason i love having all the tools for my ender 3 mounted on the printer itself is because i often use this printer in a few different places sometimes the dinner table the floor just all over my apartment so it's nice to have those tools with it all the time to make using it at different places a lot easier [Music] and now it's a lot easier to move around [Music] lastly just to complete the whole look so will there be a part four well as much as i love making these videos isn't it a bit gratuitous now to keep adding things to this one ender theory but to answer the question yes there will be a part four well kind of because there was one last thing that just came in the mail recently completely late that i wasn't able to include in this video so i'll probably make another video put some updates in there maybe a q a in there as well so if you guys have more questions and other suggestions please let me know i'll also be doing an individual video about the laser cutter as well i have some projects planned around that so expect that soon now huge shout out to paul peterson i don't have like a patreon or anything set up for you guys to be able to support my channel and what i do but paul founded the tip option on my thingiverse profile and just started sending me donations you are so cool man i didn't even know that option was there that's awesome also thanks to the facebook group i love to 3d print for giving me advice on some of these upgrades what the heck and of course huge thanks to cameron luck for making all the sick music used in my videos alright that's everything thanks for watching guys [Music] you"

    "title": "Making a Portable M4 Mac Mini",
    "transcript": "[Music] This video is sponsored by Bamboo Lab. So, so many of you guys have been asking me for a new Mac Mini project, and I honestly wasn't sure what to do at first, but then after I got my hands on one, well, some things became very obvious. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] All right, that was a fun little warm-up project, but let's finally do what we've all been thinking about. I mean, this thing is so it's tiny tiny. So tiny. So, we got to be able to create a portable setup around it, right? I mean, people are definitely trying to. They're carrying these things around with portable monitors and keyboards. And I get it. It's one of the most powerful computers you can get at this size and price tag. So, of course, people are going to try to use it portably. So, let's see what we can come up with. Here's what I want in the portable setup. I hated carrying around the keyboard for my other portable builds. So, this time I want to incorporate the Apple Magic Keyboard into the design. These are super lightweight and thin. Newer ones have a fingerprint reader, but the older models you can get for pretty cheap on the secondhand market. Next, I found this cool monitor with Visa mounting points that's almost the same size as the keyboard, so it's perfect. It's definitely on the heavier side as far as monitors go, but I like that it can be used with just one cable from the Mac Mini and it's touchscreen. The black enclosure doesn't really fit in with the Apple products, though, so let's fix that. [Music] So, these are all the ingredients, and my design will need to hold all of these pieces together somehow. Let's brainstorm. What are my constraints? Well, the monitor and the keyboard are around the same size, so those should be put together. No, no, no. The keyboard's too light and the monitor is too heavy. The whole thing would tip over. Well, the Mac Mini is also heavy. Maybe you can prop up the screen with it. Then the keyboard can just fold upwards to close. Yeah, but now the ports on the back of the Mac Mini aren't accessible. True. And the on button, too. You won't be able to turn it on like this. Well, what if I turn it on its side? This way. The ports are now accessible. And I can just turn it around, too. So then the on button is too. The Mac Mini is sticking out now. The whole thing feels bulky. Let's tuck it under the monitor, then. This is more ergonomic with the screen higher off the table. True, it won't tip over now, but it's even bulkier. If only the screen was lighter, then it won't tip over so easily. Monitor is too heavy. It's going to keep falling back. This monitor is too heavy. The keyboard's too light. Wait, we can just make the keyboard heavier. If we weigh it down with the Mac Mini, then the whole thing won't tip over. Yeah, but nobody can type like this. No, weigh it down beside the keyboard. [Music] I think this is it. I can work with [Music] this. Since this is going to be a pretty large design, I needed a larger 3D printer. So, luckily, Bamboo Lab's new H2D came at the perfect time. This is without a doubt the most advanced 3D printer I have ever owned, and the heaviest, too. This whole thing just feels so smart. If you need ventilation during a print, vents automatically open. This light shows you the progress of your prints. Perfect first print. But the dual nozzle system is the real star here. You can just tell so much engineering went into this thing. Now, since my design will require a lot of supports, I'll be trying the dual nozzle system with some dedicated support filament for those large overhangs. Let's see how it does. [Music] As expected, the supports were super easy to remove and the surface looks [Music] great. Now, just a few more parts. [Music] [Music] Now, I don't like how this plastic body sounds against my desk. So, good thing the H2D is not just a 3D printer. [Music] [Applause] [Music] And last but not least, always remember to date your work. Yeah, the H2D is also a plotter. This thing is truly the best all-in-one DIY [Music] tool. So, this is my new portable Mac Mini setup. This design ensures that everything is properly secured without losing any key features. The monitor's cable runs securely through the body underneath the keyboard. The Mac Mini's exhaust and fan intake are completely unobstructed, and so are the ports at the front and back. Thanks to the Velcro strap, the Mac Mini is held securely in place while remaining easily removable. [Music] It uses an industrial torque hinge to support the monitor and its friction is adjustable. Once dialed in, the screen stays firmly where you set it. This monitor has pretty decent resolution and colors, but it's really its aspect ratio that I love. The low profile makes it perfect for focus tasks like writing. I feel like I'm typing under typewriter when I write my scripts on this thing. The touchcreen is also surprisingly responsive, but without multi-touch support, it's unfortunately just not very useful. It's basically just tap and drag. It's not bad for drawing, but the monitor will bounce a bit when you push on it. So, this design is definitely not optimized for that. I also don't like the way the screen closes against the plastic body of the design. And since I custom painted this monitor's enclosure, it's definitely not a very durable finish. So, I don't want the paint to scratch over time as it opens and closes against the body. So, to take advantage of H2D's dual nozzle system, I'm going to try to use it to print a TPU embedded design. I usually don't do this because printing with two filament can really increase print times due to the need for, you know, pooping after every filament switch. But with dual nozzles, that's no longer a concern. The soft pads now allow the screen to close and sit gently against the body. And since opening and closing the screen was such a key interaction, it's wild how much more refined and polished the whole design feels just with this subtle improvement. Now, everyone knows that the Mac Mini's built-in speakers are awful, right? Well, interestingly enough, this monitor also has built-in speakers, which I was pretty excited about. But in a shocking twist, these are somehow even worse. Like, they're so bad. Here's the Mac Mini's speaker. And here's the monitors. So, yeah, I won't be using this. I know this isn't technically fully portable because it still requires a wall outlet. But most of the places I work on the go, like coffee shops or whatever, usually have outlets, so I don't really mind. But while I was designing this, I did get some ideas for how I would make this whole setup battery powered. It would definitely be a heavier and bulkier setup. But if you guys are interested, I would love to make a video exploring that concept, too. Let me know in the comments. And also, I created a version of this design you can 3D print on a smaller printer like the X1C or A1. So, if you want the 3D printing files for this design and the Mac Mini iPhone dock design from the start of this video for most of the Macsafe iPhones and Apple cases, consider joining my YouTube channel membership and supporting my work. In the next few days, there will also be exclusive membership content for some of the behind the scenes on how I made this video, what I learned during the design process, and detailed tutorials for how to 3D print, assemble, and build your own portable Mac Mini setups. So, hit the join button on my profile to learn more about my membership community. Anyway, I've always wanted more tools, like a laser cutter, for example, but I can't because of the size of my apartment. There's just not enough room for so many machines. And that's why I'm kind of falling in love with Bamboo Lab's new H2D. And the thing is, usually when a tool is capable of doing more, it becomes a lot harder to use as well. But the H2D kind of breaks that pattern. It can do so much. And yet, it's somehow still so easy to use. It's so quick to switch between the different tool heads, and it just feels so smart the way it can auto detect and calibrate itself for whatever it needs to do. I have never owned a laser cutter before. And yet, after unboxing this thing, I began laser cutting stuff within 10 minutes. Just as how Bamboo Lab made 3D printing so easy and accessible, they're now doing the same with plotting and laser cutting. Except the crazy part is it's all happening with just one machine. I've only had the H2D for a few weeks, but it's already pushing my imagination towards building things that no longer feel like prototypes and more like polished products. I'm not just working with a 3D printer anymore, but I now have like a full personal manufacturing hub capable of just so much more. If you want to learn more about this amazing tool, check out the links below. And huge thank you to Bamboo Lab for sponsoring this video. And with that, that's pretty much everything. Let me know in the comments if you guys would like to see a battery powered version of this Mac Mini setup or if you have other ideas for me. I'd love to hear them. I hope you guys enjoyed this project and uh yeah, thanks for watching. [Music] [Music] [Music] Hey, hey, hey. [Music]"

    "title": "Making Art with iPhone's FaceID",
    "transcript": "so one thing I've mentioned before is that I'm \nobsessed with getting more out of the things you already own and one thing a lot of US own is an \niPhone. Ever since the iPhone 10 the one feature   that I've always wanted to get more out of is \nface I mean it's a few years old now but this technology is crazy like it's not \nunlocking your phone by seeing your face using the   front-facing camera. No, because then it wouldn't \nwork in the dark or you'll be able to fool it   with a picture but you can't because it's actually \nusing a bunch of super sophisticated sensors   in this Notch. And using an IR camera you can see that \nApple's true depth camera system is shooting over   30,000 infrared dots all over my face it's then \nscanning those dots to build a mathematical model   to make sure it's me. Doing all this pretty much in \nan instant just to unlock my phone so knowing all   this for a long time I've wanted to turn my iPhone \ninto a high quality 3D scanner and even though   there are a lot of photogrammetry 3D scanning \napps out there there are only a few that actually   utilize iPhone's IR sensors for more detailed 3D \nscanning. They all kind of vary in terms of quality   and functionality but they're all pretty fun \nand the one that really got my attention is this   one called Heges... Hyges? Higgys? Anyway, it produces \nsuper detailed scans but I don't know if I'm using   the app wrong or maybe my phone's too old but \nsometimes the scans would turn out super glitchy   I love how these look but I don't want to just \ntake selfies all day.   I want to use this technique in a photo shoot  but here's the problem: let's say I invite over a model. In order to 3D Scan them I'd have to hold the phone in a way where I can see \nwhat's going on on the screen while trying to scan them. It would be very... awkward, yeah and technically \nspeaking some iPhones have a lidar on the back of them which can be used for 3D scanning \nbut the quality and resolution of the lidar scanner is just garbage compared to the FaceID sensors. So here's what I'm gonna have to do I'm going to use this camera monitor, with \na Lightning to HDMI adapter to mirror the iPhone's display So the reason I'm using these \ncamera monitors is because they have two very important features.  Once it's mirroring the \niPhone screen they allow you to zoom in and   mirror the screen since the face ID sensors are \nfacing the opposite direction And lastly, I'm going to try to use this magsafe phone holder \nso the iPhone can be easily removable. so this is the hard part I need to \ndesign something to hold all these objects together  now the easiest way to approach   something complex like this is to just \nFrankenstein the objects together first   now that the general form is defined \nI can grab some rough measurements   and then move on to detailed drawings   and now move to the digital side... this is kind of the boring part the only noteworthy thing here is that I added these tabs to some of the corners\nto help with better adhesion during 3D printing now let's get back to the more interesting stuff I came across this ribbon HDMI cable \nthat's super thin and it's perfect   because this way I can actually \nrun it through the handle like so okay so now I just \nneed someone to model for me Andrea: Hey! Scott: What the Andrea?! so the quality of the scans ranged from pretty cool \nto PlayStation 2 and NPCs and just surreal we also experimented with colored lighting   and then Andrea's partner Cory \nended up joining for a few scans too after a painstaking amount of photoshopping, I turned a few of my favorite scans into posters and got them framed for   my apartment. I went to a local FedEx office to \nget this done and the wildest thing happened. You see, when you get a poster this big done \nwith FedEx they'll print out a form for you   to sign. The form will have a small preview of \nwhat your poster will look like and it's for   you to check that the colors and everything \nlook good before they run the actual print   it's called an oversized proof approval \nform and what happened was the very nice lady at FedEx accidentally printed out this \nform in the size of the actual poster after I signed it they actually let me keep it so I \nobviously had to frame and put that up too   anyway I ended up finding a supplier that makes \nreally nice quality framed prints, so if you want   to own one of these and support my channel check \nout my store links below. I'll also be selling   puzzles of these as well they'll come in either \n520 pieces which took me a few days to complete   or 252 pieces which took my dad just a few hours.\nOkay! Thank you to Andrea and Cory for letting me   shoot with them check out their Instagrams link \nbelow they're both so cool and creative and I   had so much fun working with them I had a lot of \nfun working on this project in general and I think   it's because it kind of combines my passions for \nboth Art and Design I learned so much working with   this 3D scanner and I feel so satisfied with both \nthe design and art outcomes from this project  I might do more videos like this where I challenge \nmyself to design tools for making art I don't know... Maybe. Let me know if you guys would be into \nthat and if you've been following my Instagram   you would know that I've been messing around with \nthis project for a few years now actually and the   Heges app has actually been updated a few times \nsince I started. It doesn't actually glitch out as   much as it used to for better or worse but it's \nhonestly a pretty amazing app shout out to the   people who made it this project wouldn't have \nbeen possible without you I love this just as   a portable 3D scanner now that only occasionally \nglitches and on another note another approach to   this design would have been to actually actually \nuse a mirror to reflect the face ID sensors   forward there's a few designs for this online \nand the only reason I didn't end up doing that   and I went with this rig was just because having \nthe screen's angle adjustable made scanning a bit   more ergonomic to use but if you want to give this \nproject a go with a more straightforward design   and cheaper setup definitely check out the other \ndesigns I'll leave a few links to those below   along with the design for this. one thing I forgot \nto mention about this design is that actually   embedded magnets inside the handle as well and the \nreason is because if I ever use the camera monitor   elsewhere the HDMI cable won't have to dangle \naround and it can be secured right here at the top   and final thing huge thank you to everyone \nwho bought one of my IDIM hats and sent   me photos these photos made me so happy so \nthank you guys so much for sending them in   and I want to thank the donators too this time \nwe have Chris from station level Zero, sweet   Etsy Shop man Kian Dowd and Thiago de vita again \nthank you both for the continuous support Ricardo   Rue from Germany thank you ibang Taiwan and thank \nyou Shaggy historian do I Blankenship I'm glad you   find my videos helpful Joseph Ransom thank you for \nthe kind words Christopher Delvin Jessica Smithson   and Leandro Toledo thank you to the anonymous \ndonators too as well I see you and thank you   all so much for supporting my work and uh that's \npretty much everything thanks for watching"

    "title": "Making Furniture with a 3D Printer?! ft. Creality's CR-30",
    "transcript": "so the first youtube video i ever made for this channel was a video of me making a coffee table [Music] i built this table for my first apartment in seattle and ever since i moved into this city i no longer had access to a wood shop which means i haven't built a piece of furniture in almost three years now but that's gonna change today because tina from creality sent me a cr-30 [Music] now the beauty about this 3d printer is the fact that it actually prints on a conveyor belt that means it's really complicated and hard to use but it's really good for two things one it's really good for bulk printing this thing can print parts for you non-stop and number two well [Music] [Music] so my last apartment came with an air conditioner port which i also used for exhausting the fumes for my resin 3d printer my new apartment doesn't have it so the first thing i made on the cr30 was this thing [Music] so this thing actually turned out surprisingly straight and actually fairly strong too and what it is is it's an extender for this adapter and now i have an air conditioner port [Music] [Music] so a year ago i would have never imagined that i can 3d print something this big or that i would even want to but with this 3d printer it just made it so easy granted that did take four days to print which is a bit of a pain but i ended up replacing the stock 0.4 millimeter nozzle with a 0.8 so now i can easily half that time so if all this is possible now i should be able to design and make furniture again without a wood shop right [Music] this happened so many times like i said this is definitely a trickier printer to use but after tweaking some settings [Music] one leg ended up taking 11 hours to print [Music] the conveyor belt left marks on the prints and some of them had signs of layer shifts but they're good enough so now i just need to cut off the brims [Music] so that's pretty much everything for the legs now i just need a tabletop i thought it would be hard to find tabletops in the city but it turned out i just wasn't looking in the right places [Music] it's pretty easy to find cutting boards or serving boards that can easily be used as a table top but i ended up using this project panel from lowe's it's a lot larger thicker and it was only ten dollars [Music] [Music] so i didn't spend that much time on the design of this thing it's really similar to other side tables you can buy out there and the problem with this design is the fact that it kind of looks like a small stool and since it's in the living room that means at some point someone is going to accidentally sit on this thing and when that inevitably happens well the question is wow okay wow [Music] so keep in mind the legs had a skin thickness of 2.4 millimeters but only 15 infill so i'm pretty impressed granted i do only weigh around 140 pounds so [Music] okay and this is why the cr30 is a huge game changer for me i know this is just a side table but the point here is the fact that this 3d printer allows me to print large-scale projects i would have needed a whole wood shop to make these things before but now i can easily do it from home with a 3d printer that fits on my dining table now thank you to tina from creality for sending me the cr30 a huge shout out to all the awesome people out there supporting my channel through donations thank you to eric tweet niko rivera dean bailey brandon shores archerdesign.ca the hunger zone sharon england and john strickland thank you all so much for supporting this channel and thanks for watching [Music] [Music] [Music] my [Music]"

    "transcript": "hey I'm Scott and I used to do woodworking glass blowing casting pottery and a lot of stuff but for the last few years of my life it's actually just been [Music] [Music] so it all started when I first moved into downtown Seattle and quickly realized that woodworking in my parents's garage was not an option anymore and wood shop memberships are all way too expensive in the city so all of a sudden I was completely deprived of any ways of making stuff and as a maker not being able to realize any of my ideas or make the things that I want to make this tortured me and then I got a 3D printer and honestly at first it sucked a lot of late night's troubleshooting print failures poor quality prints there were some awful experiences but recently this technology has gotten really really good like self-calibrating perfect first layer out of the box levels of good and when I think about how 3D printing has changed my life it's not about the cool toys inventions or tools I've printed it's the little things the mundane things from my daily life that 3D printing has completely transformed like when I moved into this new apartment and I needed a key holder I realized I could or or I can 3D print it pause the print fill it with magnets and then let it finish [Music] isn't this so much more fun than anything you can find inside a store and I know it doesn't need to be this fun it's just a keyh holder but it's a keyh holder it's the first object I interact with when I get home every time I get home I'll be using this object hundreds of times so doesn't it deserve a little bit more consideration than just this there are so many boring designs that have infiltrated our lives and turn many things we do in into boring chores when they could be fun interactions or satisfying rituals I'm honestly fed up with just all the boring uninspired one-size fitall solutions that we are spoonfed there is a lot of designs out there we really shouldn't be spending our money on which is why I fell in love with the 3D printing Community because I am not alone in feeling this way there's a whole community of people who just like me believe that the everyday objects that we use can be better and more delightful here's a key holder designed by TM [Music] Fu and there's a great community of people modifying and improving each other's designs like the other day my Uno cards got ripped during a party and Hugo designed this great parametric box and then materal March remixed it and [Music] isn't that perfect I am so impressed with not just how far this technology has come in the last few years but also how large this community has grown and W I believe everyone should learn how to 3D model it's pretty incredible how much you can accomplish with a 3D printer even without that skill in fact most of the prints I make are actually free designs by other people there are also a lot of easy to ous tools now for people who don't know how to 3D model for example I wanted to gift my mom this photo of my grandma but a framed photo just feels kind of boring so I uploaded it to this to on maker world and then with a backl it's now unique one-of-a-kind gift wow with one tool I can now 3D print art I can make custom organizers tools I can 3D print actual cash these really pay themselves off I'm kidding you can't 3D print money but you can collaborate with your buddy overwork on an iPhone dock that goes so viral 17 million views on social media the artist name is overw work over Scott you Jan which is the weirdest Cloud standby doc the iPhone dock and it goes way too hard this dock is just fantastic I absolutely love it you fly to Toronto Canada and work with a 3D print Farm to get these masks produced and start a whole business in Just 2 weeks that's right we've been selling those iPhone docs for the last month and we've shipped out hundreds of them all of that was made possible with a tool that costs less than a game console or a nice pair of shoes and this wasn't always possible for most of History before access to 3D printing if I wanted to produce at this scale I would have needed to fly to the other side of the world find a supplier work with multiple Engineers to design tools dedicated to making my product tweak those tools and when everything was good to go I'd be drowning in debt before the product was even launched it doesn't even matter if you had great ideas truly inventing and innovating was a privilege only accessible to those with money which is why we've been deprived of the ability to produce things for so long DD printing isn't even new did you know that it's been around since 1986 when the world looked like this it still blows my mind to think that 3D printing was invented just 3 years after the internet went online but the technology just wasn't accessible to us it was only restricted to the rich 3D printing was only available to factories and Labs but times have changed cuz thanks to the open source community and passionate makers Forward Thinking companies this technology has completely evolved they've turned what was once a complicated Factory tool into one for hobbyists and now an affordable easy to ous Home Appliance basically 3D printing is now available to anyone with an idea the playing field has finally been leveled and it's never been easier for any of us to bring our ideas to life someone I respect once said that when you grow up when you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is your life is just to live your life inside the world try not to bash into the walls too much uh that's a very limited life life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it you can influence you can mold it so don't settle for what others have created for you make your own things once you learn that you'll never be the same again thanks for [Music] watching the I [Music] was you [Music] what but I can never be friend me we can I tell that eat your greens when you fight you fight but you do clean then you come to the bed and you love real dirty every swe drops you're realing let me get your ju peace remember when I've had the same pleas the sh of the CL never had no for"
