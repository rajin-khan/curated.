hey I'm Scott and I used to do woodworking glass blowing casting pottery and a lot of stuff but for the last few years of my life it's actually just been [Music] [Music] so it all started when I first moved into downtown Seattle and quickly realized that woodworking in my parents's garage was not an option anymore and wood shop memberships are all way too expensive in the city so all of a sudden I was completely deprived of any ways of making stuff and as a maker not being able to realize any of my ideas or make the things that I want to make this tortured me and then I got a 3D printer and honestly at first it sucked a lot of late night's troubleshooting print failures poor quality prints there were some awful experiences but recently this technology has gotten really really good like self-calibrating perfect first layer out of the box levels of good and when I think about how 3D printing has changed my life it's not about the cool toys inventions or tools I've printed it's the little things the mundane things from my daily life that 3D printing has completely transformed like when I moved into this new apartment and I needed a key holder I realized I could or or I can 3D print it pause the print fill it with magnets and then let it finish [Music] isn't this so much more fun than anything you can find inside a store and I know it doesn't need to be this fun it's just a keyh holder but it's a keyh holder it's the first object I interact with when I get home every time I get home I'll be using this object hundreds of times so doesn't it deserve a little bit more consideration than just this there are so many boring designs that have infiltrated our lives and turn many things we do in into boring chores when they could be fun interactions or satisfying rituals I'm honestly fed up with just all the boring uninspired one-size fitall solutions that we are spoonfed there is a lot of designs out there we really shouldn't be spending our money on which is why I fell in love with the 3D printing Community because I am not alone in feeling this way there's a whole community of people who just like me believe that the everyday objects that we use can be better and more delightful here's a key holder designed by TM [Music] Fu and there's a great community of people modifying and improving each other's designs like the other day my Uno cards got ripped during a party and Hugo designed this great parametric box and then materal March remixed it and [Music] isn't that perfect I am so impressed with not just how far this technology has come in the last few years but also how large this community has grown and W I believe everyone should learn how to 3D model it's pretty incredible how much you can accomplish with a 3D printer even without that skill in fact most of the prints I make are actually free designs by other people there are also a lot of easy to ous tools now for people who don't know how to 3D model for example I wanted to gift my mom this photo of my grandma but a framed photo just feels kind of boring so I uploaded it to this to on maker world and then with a backl it's now unique one-of-a-kind gift wow with one tool I can now 3D print art I can make custom organizers tools I can 3D print actual cash these really pay themselves off I'm kidding you can't 3D print money but you can collaborate with your buddy overwork on an iPhone dock that goes so viral 17 million views on social media the artist name is overw work over Scott you Jan which is the weirdest Cloud standby doc the iPhone dock and it goes way too hard this dock is just fantastic I absolutely love it you fly to Toronto Canada and work with a 3D print Farm to get these masks produced and start a whole business in Just 2 weeks that's right we've been selling those iPhone docs for the last month and we've shipped out hundreds of them all of that was made possible with a tool that costs less than a game console or a nice pair of shoes and this wasn't always possible for most of History before access to 3D printing if I wanted to produce at this scale I would have needed to fly to the other side of the world find a supplier work with multiple Engineers to design tools dedicated to making my product tweak those tools and when everything was good to go I'd be drowning in debt before the product was even launched it doesn't even matter if you had great ideas truly inventing and innovating was a privilege only accessible to those with money which is why we've been deprived of the ability to produce things for so long DD printing isn't even new did you know that it's been around since 1986 when the world looked like this it still blows my mind to think that 3D printing was invented just 3 years after the internet went online but the technology just wasn't accessible to us it was only restricted to the rich 3D printing was only available to factories and Labs but times have changed cuz thanks to the open source community and passionate makers Forward Thinking companies this technology has completely evolved they've turned what was once a complicated Factory tool into one for hobbyists and now an affordable easy to ous Home Appliance basically 3D printing is now available to anyone with an idea the playing field has finally been leveled and it's never been easier for any of us to bring our ideas to life someone I respect once said that when you grow up when you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is your life is just to live your life inside the world try not to bash into the walls too much uh that's a very limited life life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it you can influence you can mold it so don't settle for what others have created for you make your own things once you learn that you'll never be the same again thanks for [Music] watching the I [Music] was you [Music] what but I can never be friend me we can I tell that eat your greens when you fight you fight but you do clean then you come to the bed and you love real dirty every swe drops you're realing let me get your ju peace remember when I've had the same pleas the sh of the CL never had no for
