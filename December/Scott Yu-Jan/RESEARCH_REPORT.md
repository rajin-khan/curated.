# Scott Yu-Jan: Comprehensive Research Report

## Executive Summary

Scott Yu-Jan is a product designer and YouTube creator who has built an audience of over 820,000 subscribers by creating content that seamlessly blends professional design expertise with accessible DIY projects. Born in Seattle in 1994, Scott brings real-world product design experience from Google and Amazon to his YouTube channel, where he creates custom hardware solutions, 3D printing projects, and workspace optimizations that are both functional and beautiful.

**His foundational philosophy, articulated in "make your own things" (1M views), centers on democratizing design and making.** Before 3D printing, Scott was deeply involved in traditional crafts (woodworking, glass blowing, casting, pottery), but when he moved to Seattle and lost access to workshop space, he found himself "tortured" by the inability to realize his ideas. 3D printing became his salvation—not just as a tool, but as a democratizing force that leveled the playing field for invention. As he explains: *"everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it... so don't settle for what others have created for you make your own things."*

What sets Scott apart in the crowded maker/tech YouTube space is his unique combination of professional design credentials, authentic problem-solving, and a deep appreciation for design history. Unlike many tech YouTubers who focus purely on "how-to," Scott teaches viewers to think like designers, regularly referencing Dieter Rams' principles and Apple's design philosophy while creating practical solutions to his own real-world problems.

His channel has generated over 67 million views across 67 videos, with his most popular content focusing on 3D printer upgrades, custom Apple product modifications, and workspace organization. But beyond the impressive numbers, Scott has cultivated a community of makers, designers, and tech enthusiasts who appreciate both the aesthetic quality and educational depth of his content.

Scott's journey from corporate product designer to full-time creator (documented in his video "leaving Google for this") represents a growing trend of professionals leaving traditional tech roles to pursue creative independence. His success demonstrates that there's a hungry audience for content that combines professional expertise with authentic, personal storytelling.

## Creator Profile

### Background & Expertise

**Personal Background:**
- Born 1994 in Seattle, Washington
- Currently splits time between Vancouver, BC and Seattle, WA
- Started YouTube channel in November 2012 (channel created September 2012)

**Professional History:**
- **Current:** Product Designer (recently left Google to pursue YouTube full-time)
- **Previous:** Product Designer at Amazon (worked on recipient experience and fulfillment technologies)
- **Additional:** Worked with A&K Robotics on autonomous robotic floor cleaners
- **Personal Projects:** Created designingVR.org (VR design resources), "spot" water consumption assistant

**Design Philosophy:**
Scott's work is heavily influenced by:
- **Dieter Rams** - German industrial designer, Braun (1955-1995)
- **Jonathan Ive** - Former Apple head of design
- **Apple's design language** - Minimal, functional, beautiful

He explicitly applies Rams' "10 Principles of Good Design" to evaluate products and his own work, showing deep respect for design heritage.

### Origin Story

**Traditional Craft Foundation:**
Before 3D printing, Scott was deeply involved in traditional crafts: **woodworking, glass blowing, casting, and pottery**. This foundation in hands-on making informs his entire approach to design and creation.

**The Catalyst:**
When Scott moved to downtown Seattle, he lost access to his parents' garage wood shop. Wood shop memberships in the city were prohibitively expensive, leaving him "completely deprived of any ways of making stuff." As he describes in his foundational video "make your own things" (1M views): *"as a maker not being able to realize any of my ideas or make the things that I want to make this tortured me."*

**The Solution:**
3D printing became his salvation. Initially, the technology was frustrating ("a lot of late night's troubleshooting print failures, poor quality prints"), but as it improved, it transformed his ability to create. More importantly, it democratized making—turning what was once a "privilege only accessible to those with money" into something available to "anyone with an idea."

**YouTube Journey:**
Scott's YouTube journey began in 2012, but his channel truly found its voice around 2020 with his breakthrough video "First 24 Upgrades for my Ender 3 Pro - Part 1" (4.2M views). This video established his format: detailed, well-produced tutorials that combine practical how-to content with design thinking.

His decision to leave Google for full-time YouTube creation (documented in "leaving Google for this" - 281K views) represents a significant moment in his career. The video shows Scott prioritizing creative fulfillment and independence over corporate stability—a decision that resonates with many in his audience who dream of similar transitions.

**The Philosophy Video:**
His video "make your own things" (1M views, 1 year ago) serves as his manifesto, explaining how 3D printing democratized invention and how everyday objects deserve better design. This video encapsulates his entire mission and philosophy.

2. **Democratizing invention** - 3D printing has "leveled the playing field" - invention is no longer a privilege only for those with money
3. **Community-driven design** - The 3D printing community shares, remixes, and improves each other's designs
4. **Delight in the mundane** - Even simple objects like key holders deserve thoughtful design because we interact with them hundreds of times

6. **"Making weird solutions to unique problems"** - Embracing unconventional approaches
7. **The intersection of art and technology** - Blending aesthetics with functionality
8. **Teaching through doing** - Sharing the entire design process, including failures

**Core Quote from "make your own things":**
*"everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it you can influence you can mold it so don't settle for what others have created for you make your own things once you learn that you'll never be the same again"*

This philosophy is also captured in his own words: *"isn't this the point of being a maker that we can make weird solutions to our own very unique problems"*
