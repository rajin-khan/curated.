## Origin Story

**Traditional Craft Background:**
Before 3D printing, Scott was deeply involved in traditional crafts: **woodworking, glass blowing, casting, and pottery**. This foundation in hands-on making informs his entire approach to design and creation.

**The Catalyst:**
When Scott moved to downtown Seattle, he lost access to his parents' garage wood shop. Wood shop memberships in the city were prohibitively expensive, leaving him "completely deprived of any ways of making stuff." As he describes in his video "make your own things" (1M views): *"as a maker not being able to realize any of my ideas or make the things that I want to make this tortured me."*

**The Solution:**
3D printing became his salvation. Initially, the technology was frustrating ("a lot of late night's troubleshooting print failures, poor quality prints"), but as it improved, it transformed his ability to create. More importantly, it democratized making—turning what was once a "privilege only accessible to those with money" into something available to "anyone with an idea."

**YouTube Journey:**
Scott started his YouTube channel in November 2012, initially focusing on tech product creations and design projects. His channel tagline is simple and authentic: **"i like making art and design stuff"** - reflecting his genuine passion rather than trying to be overly commercial.

His journey from product designer at major tech companies to full-time content creator represents a shift toward creative independence. In his video "leaving Google for this" (281K views), he documented his decision to leave Google to pursue YouTube full-time, showing the courage to prioritize creative fulfillment over corporate stability.

**The Philosophy Video:**
His video "make your own things" (1M views, 1 year ago) serves as his manifesto, explaining how 3D printing democratized invention and how everyday objects deserve better design. This video encapsulates his entire mission and philosophy.

## Mission & Vision

Scott's mission centers on **democratizing design and making**. His foundational philosophy, articulated in "make your own things," emphasizes:

1. **"Make your own things"** - Don't settle for boring, uninspired designs. Everyday objects deserve consideration and delight.
2. **Democratizing invention** - 3D printing has "leveled the playing field" - invention is no longer a privilege only for those with money
3. **Community-driven design** - The 3D printing community shares, remixes, and improves each other's designs
4. **Delight in the mundane** - Even simple objects like key holders deserve thoughtful design because we interact with them hundreds of times
5. **Getting more out of things you already own** - Repurposing and maximizing existing products
6. **Making weird solutions to unique problems** - Embracing unconventional approaches
7. **The intersection of art and technology** - Blending aesthetics with functionality
8. **Teaching through doing** - Sharing the entire design process, including failures

**Core Quote from "make your own things":**
*"everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it you can influence you can mold it so don't settle for what others have created for you make your own things once you learn that you'll never be the same again"*

This philosophy is also captured in his own words: *"isn't this the point of being a maker that we can make weird solutions to our own very unique problems"*

## Design Philosophy

Scott's design approach is heavily influenced by:
- **Dieter Rams** - German industrial designer, Braun (mentioned explicitly in iPhone Dock video)
- **Jonathan Ive** - Former Apple head of design
- **Apple's design language** - Clean, minimal, functional aesthetics

He applies Rams' "10 Principles of Good Design" to evaluate products and his own work, showing deep respect for design history and principles.
